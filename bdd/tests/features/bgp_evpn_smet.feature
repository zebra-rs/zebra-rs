Feature: BGP EVPN IGMP/MLD Proxy — Selective Multicast (RFC 9251)
  As a network operator
  I want zebra-rs to originate a Type-6 SMET route from locally-snooped
  IGMP/MLD membership and install received SMET routes as selective
  kernel bridge MDB entries, so multicast is delivered only to PEs that
  asked for it instead of flooded over the Type-3 BUM tree.

  Test Topology — two iBGP (AS 65001) EVPN speakers on a shared transport
  bridge br0, each with a local VXLAN (VNI 10) enslaved to a per-node
  IGMP-snooping bridge br10:
  ```
  ┌───────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │                    br0                     │
  └───────────┬───────────────────┬───────────┘
              │                   │
         ┌────┴────┐         ┌────┴────┐
         │   z1    │         │   z2    │
         │ .0.1/24 │         │ .0.2/24 │
         │  br10   │         │  br10   │
         │ vxlan10 │         │ vxlan10 │
         │         │         │  host0  │  <- local (*,G) member
         └─────────┘         └─────────┘
  ```

  z2 carries a local (*,G)=239.1.1.1 membership (injected via
  `bridge mdb add`); the kernel emits RTM_NEWMDB, zebra-rs maps br10 to
  VNI 10 and originates a Type-6 SMET. z1 imports it and programs a
  selective kernel bridge MDB entry on br10 with `dst` = z2's VTEP.

  Scenario: Setup topology, EVPN iBGP, and per-node snooping bridges
    Given a clean test environment
    When I create bridge "br0"
    And I create namespace "z1" with IP "192.168.0.1/24" on bridge "br0"
    And I create namespace "z2" with IP "192.168.0.2/24" on bridge "br0"
    And I start zebra-rs in namespace "z1"
    And I start zebra-rs in namespace "z2"
    And I apply config "z1-1.yaml" to namespace "z1"
    And I apply config "z2-1.yaml" to namespace "z2"
    # zebra-rs created vxlan10 from config; enslave it to a snooping
    # bridge so membership (and received SMET) map to VNI 10.
    And I execute "ip link add br10 type bridge mcast_snooping 1" in namespace "z1"
    And I execute "ip link set vxlan10 master br10" in namespace "z1"
    And I execute "ip link set br10 up" in namespace "z1"
    And I execute "ip link add br10 type bridge mcast_snooping 1" in namespace "z2"
    And I execute "ip link set vxlan10 master br10" in namespace "z2"
    And I execute "ip link set br10 up" in namespace "z2"
    # z2's local host-facing port carries the snooped (*,G) membership.
    And I execute "ip link add host0 type dummy" in namespace "z2"
    And I execute "ip link set host0 master br10" in namespace "z2"
    And I execute "ip link set host0 up" in namespace "z2"
    And I wait 10 seconds for BGP to operate
    Then BGP session in "z1" to "192.168.0.2" should be "Established"

  Scenario: A snooped (*,G) join makes z2 originate a Type-6 SMET that z1 imports
    Given the test topology exists
    When I execute "bridge mdb add dev br10 port host0 grp 239.1.1.1 permanent" in namespace "z2"
    Then show command "show bgp evpn" in namespace "z1" should eventually contain "[6]:[0]:[0]:[*]:[32]:[239.1.1.1]:[32]:[192.168.0.2]"
    And show command "show bgp evpn" in namespace "z1" should eventually contain "RT:65001:10"

  Scenario: z1 programs the received SMET into its kernel bridge MDB
    Given the test topology exists
    # The received SMET drives `bridge mdb add dev br10 port vxlan10
    # grp 239.1.1.1` on z1. z1 has no local member, so the group can only
    # appear in its MDB via the SMET install. (Per-VTEP `dst` selectivity
    # needs a vnifilter VXLAN MDB — see the design doc; a plain VXLAN
    # registers the group on the port but the kernel drops the `dst`.)
    Then bridge mdb "br10" in namespace "z1" should eventually contain "239.1.1.1"

  Scenario: A leave withdraws the SMET and removes the MDB entry on z1
    Given the test topology exists
    When I execute "bridge mdb del dev br10 port host0 grp 239.1.1.1 permanent" in namespace "z2"
    Then show command "show bgp evpn" in namespace "z1" should eventually not contain "[6]:[0]:[0]:[*]:[32]:[239.1.1.1]"
    And bridge mdb "br10" in namespace "z1" should not contain "239.1.1.1"

  Scenario: Teardown topology
    Given the test topology exists
    When I stop zebra-rs in namespace "z1"
    And I stop zebra-rs in namespace "z2"
    And I delete namespace "z1"
    And I delete namespace "z2"
    And I delete bridge "br0"
    Then the test environment should be clean
